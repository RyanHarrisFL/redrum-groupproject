JumpIN is an application that allows the user to search for another person to do a pre-defined activity with another person on a chosen date/time.

Upon opening the application, users will be directed to the log-on page.  New users can click on the link, directing them to the sign up page.  Existing users may enter their username (email address) and password, to access their profile page.

New users, once at the sign on page, will be directed to complete the provided form in order to establish their account and set up a profile.  The new user will then be directed to the profile page.

From the profile page, the user will be shown their basic information and a button allowing them to switch to the search page.  Once on the search page, the user can define the activity, skill level, and location of where they would like to find a friend to participate in the activities with.
